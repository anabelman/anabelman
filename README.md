-  Hi, Iâ€™m @anabelman
-  Iâ€™m interested in getting to know everything I ever catch myself dreaming of knowing. 
-  Iâ€™m currently learning 3D, C# and C++!
-  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on indie projects that require animators or C#/C++ programmers!
-  How to reach me: @anabelman on Discord!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I work pretty well under pressure but it's not an "always-kind-of-thing"
